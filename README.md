# reference-collection-rework

#This website is a gallery of pictures for drawing reference.

This is a rework of the very first website that I created when I was still very new to web development.
Drawing was my hubby at that time, so I thought about making a website that I can use personally. This used to be for personal use, But since I am now showing it to some employers, I decided to change the images to something more professional and also, to avoid trouble. Since it's literally a gallery of images that I croped from the mangas that I used to read. I also discovered that pexels.com has an API and so, I decided to use that as a source of my images. This means that it won't be a renference collection anymore and that it is going to be a gallery of general images based on the search input of the user.
