# reference-collection-rework

#This website is a gallery of pictures for drawing reference.

This is a rework of the very first website That I created when I was still very new to web development.
Drawing was my hubby at that time. So I thought about making a website that I can use personally. This used to be for personal use. But since I'm am now showing it to some employers, I decided to change the images to something more professional. I also decided to use a json file and inject it to my html. Everything is working fine at the moment. Except for the fact that all the images are the same and it's not yet optimized. But it used to be. I promise.
